| **Basics**         | Core Java programs covering fundamentals, syntax, and basic operations.                                                                    |
| **Collections**    | Practical examples and interview programs using Java Collections Framework â€” sorting, filtering, grouping using `List`, `Map`, `Set`, etc. |
| **Algorithms**     | Common algorithms like sorting (Bubble, Selection, Insertion), searching, and other problem-solving examples.                              |
| **AlgorithmsL1**   | Level 1 algorithm and logic-building programs for interview preparation.                                                                   |
| **Java8**          | Examples of Java 8 features including `Stream API`, `Lambda expressions`, and functional interfaces.                                       |
| **Java25**         | Hands-on examples exploring **Java 25** features and enhancements.                                                                         |
| **Multithreading** | Programs demonstrating multithreading, synchronization, and concurrent programming concepts.                                               |
| **Stream**         | Stream API programs focusing on filtering, mapping, grouping, and reducing data in Java.                                                   |
| **Advance**        | Advanced Java concepts and design patterns â€” includes examples like the **Singleton Design Pattern**.                                      |
